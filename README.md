# openscad-vodafone-smart-router-base

This is a replacement part for the Vodafone Smart Router (of Sagem manufacture) used by Vodafone Portugal and other operations in Europe.

This device has a built-in ONT, 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports, internal Wi-Fi, voice, USB 2.0 and coax, but also has a particularly poorly thought out base that prevents you from mounting it flush against a wall or placing it horizontally, so I designed this to replace the round "foot".

I recommend adding a little clearance (~2mm or so) to this by sticking on some adhesive rubber feet (there are a few plates for that purpose), so that there is enough airflow to cool the device by convection.

Printing suitable wall mount clips is left as an exercise to the reader (or a later revision).
